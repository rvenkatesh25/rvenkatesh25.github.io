Recently, one of my profs Mr. Bean (name changed due to survival reasons) announced in the class that in this term the exams won't be open-book as they were in the last term. We will have conventional closed-book exams this time. I didn't know whether to be happy or sad on hearing this. So here's a little analysis -<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_708_w3vf51k/ReFObDvLvsI/AAAAAAAAACw/Cy4TXZTS-bo/s1600-h/exams.gif"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_708_w3vf51k/ReFObDvLvsI/AAAAAAAAACw/Cy4TXZTS-bo/s200/exams.gif" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5035392085143568066" border="0" /></a><br />Advantages of open-book exams:<br />   <ul><li>If you manage to identify the chapter correctly, your blind shot will at least hit the zone, if not the target.<br /><br /></li><li>You only have to exchange the page numbers, instead of the whole answers.<br /><br /></li><li>It’s easier to pretend that you are thinking when you are groping into a book. This comes in handy when the subject prof is invigilating as well.<br /><br /></li><li>At least, now you can pass time for three hours, which again, can impress the invigilator.<br /><br /></li><li>You can start preparing for the re-exam then and there.</li></ul>      <p class="MsoNormal">Disadvantages:</p><ul><li>The questions asked are either unsolved exercises or the author himself would have proclaimed that to be “out of the scope of this book”.<br /><br /></li><li>You don’t get questions like “define this” where you can write “the blah blah of the blah blah is called new blah new blah” and secure 2 marks.<br /><br /></li><li>You feel empowered to do nothing. You can’t even make the excuse “I was not prepared, else I would have..“ to yourself.<br /><br /></li><li>You have to buy the book.</li></ul>     And the result is - I am still confused. How the heavens does the prof manages to do this every single time!!!

# About

My name is Bernardo Pacheco. I'm a software engineer living and working at [Dot Legend][5] in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

I’ve attended the [Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ)][1] for a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in Computer Science.

Currently I am involved with the full-stack JavaScript developing web and mobile applications with technologies including HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, NodeJS and MongoDB. I’ve worked on different things already and I have experience in the .NET framework, C#, Entity Framework, ASP .NET MVC, SQL Server, Git and Mercurial. I use fish as my command line shell and my preferred editor is vim. 

I have a great interest in cryptography. It is a fascinating area with a beautiful mathematics and with a history of amazing people.

I like to share what I know. I appreciate who does the same.
